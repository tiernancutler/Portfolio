        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>App Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Chop is a cooking expert app that allows users to connect virtually with a professional chef via chat, phone or video call to solve all their culinary needs. Whether you need help with a tricky recipe or want to improve your basic cooking
          techniques, top chefs are just a click away. Think of the concept behind Airbnb, but instead of searching for the perfect apartment and booking your getaway, you are searching for an expert chef and booking a virtual lesson!

            <h3>Defining the Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>
              Our home cooks need a way to connect with a professional chef because they wish to learn how to cook a new dish or master a new culinary skill.
            </p>
            <h3>Creating a Competitor Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              There is currently no other cooking expert apps available. Therefore, I chose to review a mix of cooking apps and other expert apps.
            </p>
            <h3>Conducting User Surveys & Interviews</h3>
            <p>
              Survey with 53 participants and 6 user interviews to discover patterns, cooking habits, behaviors, challenges and needs.
            </p>
            <h3>Analyzing the Data</h3>
            <p>
              Organized results with card sorting and affinity mapping.

        <h3>Developing User Personas, Journeys and Flows</h3>
        <p>
          Based off data results, I created 3 User Personas. Kelsey: The Novice | John: The Master Chef | Prisha: Average Cook. It was then time to see what kind of tasks users would actually need to complete within the app and their journey as they
          did so.

        <h3>Sketches & Wireframes</h3>
        <p>
          I began with sketches in order to feel out the basic elements and screen layout without getting caught up in the details. Once I was happy with the overall impression of the sketches, I translated those into mid-fidelity wireframes using
          Adobe XD.

        <h3>Mid-Fidelity and Early Prototyping</h3>
        <p>
          Now that the user flows were officially in a digital form, it was time to start adding more detail so testing could commence. In this round of iterations I focused on building out the onboarding process so the user’s home feed would be more
          personalized to their preferences.

        <h3>Moderated User Testing</h3>
        <p>
          I conducted 6 moderated remote tests in which I could see the participants’ reactions as well as capture their screen movements as they completed 3 different tasks. Analyzed the results with affinity mapping and rainbow spreadsheet to
          easily allow me to classify and rank errors based on their severity level

        <h3>Iterations</h3>
        <p>The navigation of the app was proving to be intuitive and the ease with which all 6 participants completed the tasks validated my current design decisions. However, 3 key issues discovered.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="columns">
            <h3>Issue 1: Skipping the onboarding process</h3>
            <p>
              Problem (Medium): Although not technically wrong, 3 of the 6 users immediately went to click “Start Cooking” instead of reading the onboarding screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              Change: Based off user feedback, the onboarding isn’t needed and just makes the opening screen cluttered, so cut it completely to focus on Sign Up button and making the onboarding process more enjoyable for the user

          <div class="columns">
            <h3>Issue 2: Unclear layout of Chef Profile Page</h3>
            <p>
              Problem (High): All users took a minute to locate the “Book A Lesson” Button on the chef’s profile page as originally they had to scroll all the way down to the bottom. They also wanted to know the chef’s specialty dishes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Change: I moved the button up to the top of the page so it is easy to find, and added a scrolling image library of the chef’s top dishes behind their profile picture.

            <h3>Issue 3: Unknown Timezone</h3>
            <p>
              Problem (High): 2 users asked how would they know what time zone the lesson was taking place in.
            </p>
            <p>
              Change: I have added the time zone to the booking page as it will auto-populate to where the user is currently located. It is listed with an info button that will produce a pop-up box if the user clicks on the icon.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>
          The next steps for chop will involve building out more user flows and the other various areas of the app such as the lesson portal. Once these have been developed, it will be ready for hand off to developers. As the app continues to
          develop, it will undergo constant user testing and iterations to continue to validate design updates.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
        <p>
          The more user testing and feedback the better! Quick rounds of iteration and testing lead to problem-discovery and solution-creation and truly validate all design decisions made along the development journey. Keep it simple until you’ve
          worked out the kinks! To not get caught up in small details while needing to still focus on big-picture.
